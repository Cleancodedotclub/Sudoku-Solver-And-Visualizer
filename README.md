The Python Sudoku Solver and Visualization GitHub repository is a project that provides a simple Sudoku solver and a GUI to visualize the solutions. The solver is implemented using a recursive backtracking algorithm, which is a common approach to solving Sudoku puzzles. The GUI is built using the Pygame library and allows users to input Sudoku puzzles, solve them, and visualize the solutions. The project also includes a generator that can generate random Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulties. The code is well-documented and organized, making it easy to understand and extend for anyone interested in learning more about Sudoku solving algorithms or building their own Sudoku applications.
